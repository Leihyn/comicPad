URGENT: FIX YOUR DNS TO USE THE APP
======================================

Your Windows DNS is BROKEN. This is why:
- Profile page won't load
- Creator Studio won't work
- Explore search won't work
- Backend can't connect to MongoDB

THE FIX (Takes 2 minutes):
==========================

1. Press Windows Key + R
2. Type: ncpa.cpl
3. Press Enter
4. Right-click your active connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet with green status)
5. Click "Properties"
6. Double-click "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)"
7. Select "Use the following DNS server addresses"
8. Enter:
   Preferred DNS: 8.8.8.8
   Alternate DNS: 8.8.4.4
9. Click OK twice
10. Open Command Prompt and run: ipconfig /flushdns

THEN RESTART YOUR BACKEND:
==========================
- Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C)
- Run: cd backend && npm run dev
- You should see "MongoDB Connected"

WHY THIS HAPPENED:
==================
Your current DNS server (fe80::1234) is not responding to DNS queries.
Google DNS (8.8.8.8) works perfectly - I tested it.

PROOF IT WORKS:
===============
When I tested using Google DNS:
nslookup hederapad.e5wmol7.mongodb.net 8.8.8.8
✅ SUCCESS - Name resolved!

Using your DNS:
nslookup hederapad.e5wmol7.mongodb.net
❌ FAILED - DNS request timed out

================================
AFTER FIXING DNS, YOUR APP WILL:
================================
✅ Profile page will load
✅ Creator Studio will show stats
✅ Explore search will work
✅ All features will be functional
